# STAT545-participation


This is the participation repo for [STAT 545](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/#about). In this course, R and GitHub were introduced. The typical workflow in GitHut, markdown and R Markdown were introduced and practiced in producing this participation repo. `Tidyverse` and `ggplot` was used in data analysis and figure production. 

It contains 14 in-class exercises:
